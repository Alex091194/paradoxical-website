        <h1>The Coastline Paradox</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p> The coastline paradox is the counterintuitive observation that the coastline of a landmass does not have a
            well defined length. This is because coastlines are formed via various natural events, and thus has a shape
            that has been created in a statistically random way. The length of a coastline thus depends on the method
            used to approximate its true length; since coastlines have features that vary massively in size, from
            hundreds of kilometers, to fractions of a millmeter, there is no obvious size of the smallest feature that
            should be taken into considering while measuring the length. </p>

        <h2>Using Lines</h2>

        <p>Perhaps the most intuitive way of calculating the length of a coastline would be to decide on a line length,
            say 1km, and then see how many of those lines can fit (as best as one can) around the coast, and then count
            the number of lines to obtain the length. The issue with this method lies in the complexity of the coastline
            - for a smooth coastline such as South Africa, a reasonably accurate measurement would be obtained, however,
            somewhere with a very ragged coastline, such as Norway, would get a much less accurate result, unless the
            lengths of the lines used were extremely small. Setting aside the difficulty in finding the best fit for
            such small lines, at which point should one say that the line is small enough? At 100m? At 1m? The smallest
            theoretical length
            that could be used is known as a Planck length, which is 1.6x10^-35m (that is 0.000...16m, with there being
            35 zeroes in total). This leads on to the problem of
            fractals - these are curves whose complexity changes depending on measurement scale. The issue is that these
            fractals, as you zoom in further and further with near-infinite resolution, have increasing lengths - as a
            matter of fact they tend towards infinity. It is because of this that is there no true accurate measurement
            of a coastline. The images on the right show how well lines of length 100km and 50km fit around the British
            coast, with a total measurement of 2,800km and 3,400km respectively. </p>

        <h2>Box-counting method</h2>
        <img src="britain_box.png" alt="british coastline divided into boxes" ALIGN="left" width="500" height="200">
        <p style="width:75%">One method of calculating the fractal dimension of a set S in Euclidean space, or more
            generally a metric
            space, is the Minkowski-Bouligand dimension method. To calculate the dimension, one needs to imagine that
            the fractal (or in our case, coastline) is lying on an evenly spaced grid, and count how many boxes are
            required to cover the set. The box counting method is calculated by seeing how this number changes as the
            grid is made finer. The images on the left show how the varying number of boxes can fit around the British
            coast.</p>
