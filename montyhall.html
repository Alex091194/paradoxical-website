        <div>
            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>The Monty Hall Paradox is a brain teaser in the form of a probability puzzle, based loosely on the
                American
                TV show Let's Make A Deal, and named after the show's original host, Monty Hall. The problem was
                originally
                posed (and solved) in a letter to the American Statistician by Steve Selvin in 1975.

                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>The problem became famous as a question when a reader's letter quoted in the "Ask Marilyn" column of
                    the
                    Parade magazine in 1990. The question reads as follows:</p>
                <p>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car;
                    behind
                    the others, goats. You pick a door, say No.1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens
                    another
                    door, say No.3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No.2?". Is it to
                    your
                    advantage to switch your choice?</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Common Misconceptions</h3>
                <p>Perhaps the most common (and incorrect) line of thinking is that originally, when you first pick a
                    door,
                    you
                    have a one in three chance of picking the car, as there is one car and three doors. However, once
                    Monty
                    opens one of the doors, there is a one in two chance that the door you picked contains the car,
                    since
                    there
                    is one car and two doors. With this line of reasoning, one would think that it doesn't matter
                    whether
                    you
                    choose to stick with your original choice or swap, both are equally likely to contain the car.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>Perhaps the easiest way to get your head around this problem is to consider that the probability of
                    choosing the car originally is one in three, this means that the probability of the contestant
                    picking
                    the goat is
                    two in three. The probability that one picked the car doesn't change when the host opens the door
                    that
                    is <b>guaranteed</b> to contain the goat, therefore the probability that the goat is behind the door
                    the host chose not to open effectively gets combined with the one he did open. In other words, there
                    is
                    a one in three chance that the original choice contains the car, and two in three chance that it
                    doesn't, even after a door has been opened. It is therefore in the contestant's best interest to
                    switch
                    when given the opportunity.</p>
