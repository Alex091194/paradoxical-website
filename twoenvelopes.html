        <h1>The Two Envelopes Paradox</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>The two envelopes problem is a paradox in logic which is of special interest in decision theory, and for the
            Bayesian interpretation of probability theory. The problem is as follows: <br>
            <br>

            "You are given two indistinguishable envelopes, each containing money. One contains twice as much as the
            other. You may pick one envelope and keep the money it contains. Having chosen an envelope at will, but
            before inspecting it, you are given the chance to switch envelopes. Should you switch?"
            <br>
            <br>
            Although it may seem that there is no point in switching since the problem is symemetric, one may think that
            since you stand to gain twice as much money if you switch while risking only a loss of half of what you
            currently have, it is possible to argue that it is more beneficial to switch.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Simple algebraic approach</h2>
        <p>Formulating this in to a simple decision table, we get:</p>

        <table style="width:25%">
            <tr>
                <th>Your Choice</th>
                <th>Other Choice</th>
                <th>Money gained if switched</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td style="text-align:center">X</td>
                <td style="text-align:center">2X</td>
                <td style="text-align:center">X</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td style="text-align:center">2X</td>
                <td style="text-align:center">X</td>
                <td style="text-align:center">-X</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>So although doubling your money sounds like you stand to gain more than halving your money, the actual
            gain/loss is equivalent. This approach suggests that making the switch is irrelevant, your expected outcome
            is the same.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>The switching argument</h2>
        <p>Another way to look at the problem is as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>I denote by A the amount in my selected envelope.</li>
            <li>The probability that A is smaller is 1/2, and that it is the larger amount is also 1/2.</li>
            <li>The other envelope may contain either 2A or A/2.</li>
            <li>If A is the smaller amount, then the other envelope contains 2A.</li>
            <li>If A is the larger amount, then the other envelope contains A/2.</li>
            <li>Thus the other envelope either contains 2A with probability 1/2 and A/2 with probability 1/2.</li>
            <li>So the expected value of the money in the other envelope is: 0.5(2A) + 0.5(A/2) = 5A/4.</li>
            <li>This is greater than A so, on average, I gain by swapping.</li>
            <li>After the switch, I can denote that content by B and reason in exactly the same manner as above.</li>
            <li>I will conclude that the most rational thing to do is swap back again.</li>
            <li>To be rational, I will thus end up swapping the envelopes indefinately.</li>
            <li>As it seems more rational to open just any envelope than to swap indefinately, we have a contradiction.
            </li>
        </ol>
